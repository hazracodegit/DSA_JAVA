### Binary Search — Complete Explanation
✅ What is Binary Search?

Binary Search is an efficient searching algorithm used to find an element in a sorted array.

Instead of checking one-by-one like linear search, it:
👉 Divides the search space into half every step

❗ Condition to Use Binary Search

✅ Array must be sorted (ascending or descending)
  🧠 Basic Idea

1. Take low and high
2. Find mid
3. Compare mid with target
4. Eliminate half of the array
  ⏱ Time Complexity
Case	Time
Best	O(1)
Average	O(log n)
Worst	O(log n)
Iterative Approach:
  int binarySearch(int[] arr, int target) {
    int low = 0, high = arr.length - 1;

    while (low <= high) {
        int mid = low + (high - low) / 2; // prevents overflow

        if (arr[mid] == target)
            return mid;
        else if (arr[mid] < target)
            low = mid + 1;
        else
            high = mid - 1;
    }
    return -1;
}
